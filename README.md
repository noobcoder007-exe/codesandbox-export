# Note-making App 


DESCRIPTION



Welcome aboard fellow developers, this is a file about the note-making app and I will discuss on each and every detail on how this project was built. 


#FIRST PHASE

For the development of this project, we were taught the basics of HTML, CSS and JS.
The HTML is a skeletal structure of a wesite, CSS is a way of styling the web app as in clothes for a human.
Javascript gives the dynamic to the part where it can be used for accessing it by the user.


#SECOND PHASE

After learning about the basics of Js, we jumped onto the project by creating a static template on CodeSandbox
A public folder was created for the html and css files respectively named as index.html and style.css.
In the html file, we linked the style.css file through an tag as link in HTML
gave the title as Note-making app and inserted a tag div with class root.

#PHASE THREE


In the next part, we were totally dependent upon the JS and React Js where most of the work had to be done.
We created an src folder in which stored was a file named as index.js as well as a folder of components.
In the components follder, we created several new files named as App.jsx, Header.jsx, Footer.jsx, Notes.jsx


Here, firstly we created a header and a footer for the app in the respective files using js and React js
Afterwards, we exported the files from their respective location to the App.jsx file.
in the Notes.jsx file, we coded so that it can contain the required notes for the user to access.

Then, in the App.jsx file, we used react by importing it 
as well as importing header, footer and notes from their respective files, then made a function to contain all this in one page allowing the user to access this.

The function App was exported from App.jsx file into the index.js file.
ReactDom was used to render the app so that it an be seen.

#PHASE FOUR

The last part of the project was majorly provided by our mentor from Devtown that was the CSS part of the project.
We were instructed to follow the ruleset and styling provided by him and if we wanted to, we had the permission to change the styling as per our interest.
